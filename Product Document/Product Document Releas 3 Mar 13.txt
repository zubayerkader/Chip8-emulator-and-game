# **Product Document Group 12 release 3**
---
 ***Denotes Changes**
### **Introduction**
**What the project is about:**
   * Implementing a Chip 8 emulator in JavaScript,
   * A couple of Chip 8 games, 
   * Use automated testing to debug the emulator,
   * Implement some useful programs using chip8,
   * Implement a visualizer to visualize our chip8 code line by line.

### **Project Organization**
---
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting schedule
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;Mon 10:30am - 11:30am

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication tools/techniques our team plans to use
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;Discord

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software repository your team plans to use
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub


### **Risk Analysis**
---
   *  **People leaving the group**
       * Solved by splitting the work evenly among group members so if absences occur there is still someone working on all the modules.

   * **Inexperience with Javascript and Chip 8 system**
       * Learning as we program and debugging as we go so we can get work done despite our inexperience
