 ***Denotes Changes**
### **Introduction**
**WhatÅfs the project is about:**
   * Implementing a Chip 8 emulator in JavaScript,
   * A couple of Chip 8 games, 
   * Use automated testing to debug the emulator,
   * Implement some useful programs using chip8,
   * Implement a visualizer to visualize our chip8 code line by line.

### **Project Organization**
---
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting schedule
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;Mon 10:30am - 11:30am

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication tools/techniques our team plans to use
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;Discord

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software repository your team plans to use
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;Github


### **Risk Analysis**
---
   *  **People leaving the group**
       * Solved by splitting the work evenly among group members so if absences occur there is still someone working on all the modules.

   * **Inexperience with Javascript and Chip 8 system**
       * Learning as we program and debugging as we go so we can get work done despite our inexperience

### **Product Document Release 1 Feb 6th 2019 Changes Summary**
**New**
 #### Finished for release 1
   * Buggy first game
   * Buggy testing tool
   * Skeleton of emulator(opcodes and renderer)


 #### Features planned for next release:
   *  Users can load chip8 files into the chip8 memory
   *  Users can interact with chip8 keyboard
   *  Memory will now be displayed
   *  Users can go backwards in the program
   *  The first game will be done as for an example for users

#### Product release:
   *  Usable version of the software in Cmpt276release1.zip. Please see HowToRun.txt for instructions.
   *  Automated testing for the release is also included. Please see HowToTest.txt.
   *  A buggy first game is one of the features planned to be done before release 1, however due to inexperience with Chip8 language we couldn't get it done.
   *  Rendering the display, register and flags is an unplanned features that was implemented. To compensate for the lack of first game.
