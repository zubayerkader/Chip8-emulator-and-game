Went through David Winter’s WORM3 game to write the snake game.

Used Christian Egeberg’s assembler to convert snake.asm to binary

Used Alexander Dickson’s chip8 emulator to test the game.
In order to play:
1. open the index.html
2. select “snake” from the drop down game selector.

The game is still buggy and does not run. It will hopefully be ready to play by release 2 (27th Feb 2019).
