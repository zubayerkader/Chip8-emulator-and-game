Went through David Winter’s WORM3 game to write the snake game.

Used Christian Egeberg’s assembler to convert snake.asm to binary

Used Alexander Dickson’s chip8 emulator to test the game.
In order to play:
1. open the index.html in firefox
2. select “snake” from the drop down game selector.
3. press A or R on the keyboard to move

The game is still buggy and but you can play it.
Known bugs:
1. BCD display
2. does not recognize boundary hits
