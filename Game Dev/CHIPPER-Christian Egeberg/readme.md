# Chipper Assembler

Chipper assembler is written by Christian Egeberg.

The only place I was able to find the source was in David Winters zip file of
Chip-8 goodies.  I suspect it was posted on Usenet based on other locations
I have seen the document that accompanies the assembler.

Just copying into my repo for the purposes of preserving it.

## Compiling chipper

gcc CHIPPER.C -o chipper

## Assembling a Chip-8 ROM

./chipper output.rom input.asm
